For a positive normalised floating point, mantissa is given by m0.m1m2m3m4......with non-zero m0. In binary radix, the leading bit will thus be always 1.
In a denormal number,it can be represented as 0.m1m2m3..... In binary radix, the leading bit is always 0.Denormal numbers are closer to zero than the 
smallest normal number. Denormal value can be thought as the flaoting-point number with least possible value of its exponent.

Normal value representation: 1.significand bits × 2^exp
Denormal value representation: 0.significand bits × 2^exp

The smallest normal and subnormal values are 1.000....00000 x 2^exp and 0.000.....01 x 2^exp respectively.
