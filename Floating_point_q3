Diffrenet rouding methods are:

(1) Rounding to nearest, ties to even: Rounds to the nearest value. For the numbers in the middle rounding is done such that the least significant digit
                                       is even.

(2) Rounding to nearest, ties away from zero: Rounds to the nearest value. For the numbers in the middle rounding is done such that they are seemed to be
                                              pulled away from zero i.e, positive numbers to the next higher and negative numbers to just lower one.

(3) Round up: Rounds to the nearest value. For the numbers in the middle rounding is done to get the next higher number.
 
(4) Round down:  Rounds to the nearest value. For the numbers in the middle rounding is done to get the lower number.

(5) Round toward zero: Rounds to the nearest value. For the numbers in the middle rounding is done such that they are seemed to be
                                              pulled towards zero i.e, negative numbers to the next higher and positive numbers to just lower one.
